# Machine Learning

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing various machine learning techniques. I have organized the content into two main categories:

## Supervised Machine Learning

In the "Supervised Machine Learning" folder, you will find Jupyter Notebook files containing implementations, explanations, and problem-solving exercises related to supervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are trained on labeled datasets, making predictions based on input features.

Explore topics such as:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- and more!

## Unsupervised Machine Learning

The "Unsupervised Machine Learning" folder contains Jupyter Notebooks focusing on unsupervised learning techniques. Unsupervised learning involves working with unlabeled data, and algorithms aim to discover patterns or structures within the data.

Dive into topics including:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- and more!

Feel free to explore the notebooks, try out the examples, and work through the problems. Each notebook is designed to provide hands-on experience with machine learning concepts, and I encourage you to experiment, modify code, and gain a deeper understanding of the algorithms.

Happy learning!
